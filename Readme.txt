CIS-698 Independent Study
Guided by: Moonwon Chung
----------------------------------

Objective:
To build a machine learning based feature extraction algorithm for text mining conflict minerals reports

Tasks to do:
  a. Outline the scope/scale of the project
  b. Data collection from SEC database for conflict mineral reports
  c. Develop training dataset for feature extraction
  d. Develop feature extraction algorithm for reports
  e. Iterate and tune model hyperparameters

Deliverables
  a. Progress report during regular research meetings (2 sessions per week)
  b. Complete a minimum 5-page paper summarizing the applied method and the results of the prediction outcomes of the      machine learning model
